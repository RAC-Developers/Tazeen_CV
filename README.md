# Personal-Resume
App Template for Creating your own Personal Resume. Its an instant application in which "App Linking" is integrated with my github.io page. See the app linking tutorial from here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpaByLW_ctw  For app linking to my github.io page I used the following repo: https://github.com/shahwaiz90/shahwaiz90.github.io (see its config and make your own github.io)

What you need to do:
Make a recycle view in it. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGGT_jfZQrA)
Upload the app to play store (https://play.google.com/apps/publish) which means they should have the logos and banner designed as well. More details by clicking the link.
Use App Linking in it. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpaByLW_ctw)
Generate signed apk (they will need to create a keystore as well)
Some images are missing from some density buckets, they need to fill those as well
Edit strings.xml file according to their profiles.
